            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Git History Editor</b> is a simple tool intended to help you edit your git history.
                Just import the result of your <code> git log </code> to get started.
                <br>
                You'll be able to edit author names and emails, commit messages, and even the time and date of your
                commits.
            </p>
            <h2>Why ?</h2>
            <p> There are multiple reasons why you'd want to edit your commits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you committed with the wrong name or email</li>
                <li>I you want to edit your old and crappy commit messages</li>
                <li>To make people think that you work / don't work at a specific time of the day</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How ?</h2>
            <p>
                To import your commit history, execute the following command in your project directory, then paste
                the result below.
                <br>

                <b>Warning:</b> When changing the information of past commits, your are effectively <b>rewriting commit history</b>.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is nothing to take lightly: you will create new commit objects in this process, which can become a
                serious problem for your collaborators, because they might have already based new work on some of the original commits.
                <br>
                Therefore, you might not want to use this tool on commits already pushed, unless you work alone on the project.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you're sure about what you're doing, you can overwrite pushed commits using <code>git push --force-with-lease</code>.
